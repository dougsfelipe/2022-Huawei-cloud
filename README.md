# 2022 Huawei Cloud Competition - Despro - Desire Process

[Screenshoot]

## Overview 

[Screenshoot2]

We developed DesPro, a tool aiming to load process information automatically and display new developments through a graph system. The information is stored in the database for future analysis. After loading the data, the discovered processes are displayed in an interactive and intuitive manner, allowing specialists and officials to easily analyze the graph in search of possible bottlenecks and deviations from the desired processes. To further enhance user analysis, DesPro counts with filtering options, allowing users to restrict the pool of data being analyzed by factors such as date intervals or other criteria.
